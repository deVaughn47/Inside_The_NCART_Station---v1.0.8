# Inside-The-NCART-Station---v1.0.8
As an avid Cyberpunk 2077, I took it upon myself to improve one of my favorite mods called 'Inside Station' by tidusMD. 

Inside Station is a powerful and versatile mod for Cyberpunk 2077 that enhances in-game station interactions, teleportation mechanics, and overall user experience. Built with modularity and robustness in mind, this mod ensures seamless integration and provides developers with a solid foundation for future enhancements.


The features I've added in this v1.0.8 update include:  

Modular Architecture: Organized into distinct modules for easy maintenance and scalability.

Robust Error Handling: Utilizes pcall() for safe module loading, preventing runtime crashes.

Enhanced Logging System: Comprehensive logging with multiple severity levels (Info, Debug, Error, Critical) to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

Proximity Detection: Detects player proximity to train stations, enabling context-sensitive features like teleportation and UI updates.

Teleportation Mechanics: Seamless teleportation functionality within stations, reducing load times and enhancing immersion.

Visual Effects: Optional glitch effects during fast travel to enrich visual feedback.

Configurable Activation Radius: Easily adjustable radius for proximity-based features to suit player preferences.

Debugging Tools: Integrated ImGui interface for real-time debugging and visualization of in-game elements.

Performance Optimization: Throttled Cron tasks to ensure minimal performance impact when inactive.
